      After he arrives to help him, Manette uses his influence and connections

      At the end of the eighteenth century, France and England are suffering
      from different social ills. That is the setting in which we meet Jerry
      Cruncher, an employee in Tellson’s Bank, who sends an urgent message to
      Jarvis Lorry to meet a woman in Dover. Lorry responds back mysteriously
      with the words: Recalled to life. He indeed meets the young woman at
      Dover. Her name is Lucie Manette, and she is the daughter of an eminent
      doctor with glory days that have passed, who had just been found in
      France. Lorry joins Lucie on her journey to Paris and escorts her to the
      meeting with Defarge, who was once a servant of her father. She finds out
      that her father spends all the time making shoes, and that he went mad
      after spending almost two decades in prison in Bastille. Lorry believes
      that Lucie if she finds it in herself to forgive him and love him, can
      bring him back to life. What he believes turns out to be true. A few years
      later, Charles Darnay is accused that he has committed treason against the
      English king. He is represented by Stryver, who is known to be a great
      lawyer, but actually, his drunk colleague Carton who is nowhere near as
      good as him is the one that saves him from the court by pointing out that
      even him bears a resemblance to the spy the authorities believed exists.
      After he is set free, Carton hangs out with Darnay, and we realize he
      resents him because he finds a resemblance to everything that he has once
      wanted to be, but in the end, give up. In the meantime, in France, we meet
      Darnay’s uncle, the cruel Marquis Evrémonde. The first impression we have
      of this men is him running down a plebian child while he is moving with
      his carriage.
